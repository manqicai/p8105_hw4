#Problem 1 
The project lead will load and tidy the data for this problem. The original data file includes data in “wide” format: the post-natal days on which developmental landmarks are reached are stored in columns called PD_outcome. The project lead will convert these data to “long” format, using reasonable variable names and values.

The collaborator will create a plot showing the distribution of post-natal days for each developmental landmark.

#Problem 2 
The project lead will load and tidy the data for this problem. Combine the data in pols-month.csv and GDP.csv based on the date / month (use lubridate::floor_date to collase dates to the first day of the month).

The collaborator will create a plot showing the GDP value over time, including the party of the president in an informative aesthetic.

```{r load datasets}
pols_month_data <- read_csv("../data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv", col_types = "ciiiiiiii") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(mon = as.Date(mon),
         mon = lubridate::floor_date(mon, unit = "month")) %>% 
  rename(date = mon)
   

gdp_data <- read_csv("../data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/GDP.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::floor_date(date, unit = "month"))

```

```{r load and tidy data}
combine_data <- inner_join(pols_month_data, gdp_data, by = "date") %>% 
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop")) %>% 
  select(- prez_gop, - prez_dem)
```


```{r}
combine_data %>% 
  filter(value != ".") %>% 
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))%>% 
  group_by(president) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, color = president)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1)) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks = "36 month") +
  labs(title = "GDP Value Over Time", x = "Timeline", y = "GDP value") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

From the plot, we could know that at most of time US maintains positive GDP increasing value, but they have dramatic domnfall from year 1948 to 1949 and year 2007 to 2008 (financial crisis period). And it tooks less than two year for them to bounce back at normal GDP level, and these are both happened during the democrat president period.
